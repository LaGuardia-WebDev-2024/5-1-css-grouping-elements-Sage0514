    <p>
      Groupers are
      <span id="teleosts"> <strong> teleosts </strong> </span> (ray-finned
      fishes), typically having a stout body and a large mouth. They can be
      quite large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100 kg are not
      uncommon, though obviously in such a large group, species vary
      considerably. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do
      not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they have heavy
      crushing tooth plates inside the pharynx. They habitually eat fish,
      octopuses, and crustaceans. Reports of fatal attacks on humans by the
      largest species, the giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) are
      unconfirmed.

      Their mouths and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their
      prey in from a distance. They also use their mouths to dig into sand to
      form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills.
      Their gill muscles are so powerful, it is nearly impossible to pull them
      out of a cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock
      themselves in.
